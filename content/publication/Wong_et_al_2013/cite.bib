   abstract = "Numerous investigations of these abilities have employed variants
               of goal-directed aiming tasks because the Fitts's law equation
               reliably captures the mathematical relationship between movement
               time (MT) and accuracy requirements. The emergence of Fitts's
               speed-accuracy relationship during movement execution,
               perception, and imagination has led to the suggestion that these
               processes rely on common neural codes. This common coding account
               is based on the notion that the neural codes used to generate an
               action are tightly bound to the codes that represent the
               perceptual consequences of that action. It is suggested that
               during action imagination and perception the bound codes are
               activated offline through an action simulation. The present study
               provided a comprehensive testing of this common coding hypothesis
               by examining the characteristics of the Fitts relationship in
               movement execution, perception, and imagination within the same
               individuals. Participants were required to imagine and perceive
               reciprocal aiming movements with varying accuracy requirements
               before and after actually executing the movements. Consistent
               with the common coding account, the Fitts relationship was
               observed in all conditions. Critically, the slopes of the
               regression lines across tasks were not different suggesting that
               the core of the speed-accuracy trade-off was consistent across
               conditions. In addition, it was found that incidental limb
               position variability scaled to the amplitude of imagined
               movements. This motor overflow suggests motor system activation
               during action imagination. Overall, the results support the
               hypothesis that action execution, perception, and imagination
               rely on a common coding system. \copyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.",
